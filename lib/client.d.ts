/**
 * Framework-agnostic orchestrator. `PoseTrackerProvider` is a thin React
 * wrapper around this class.
 *
 * Lifecycle (exposed as `PoseTrackerStatus`):
 *   idle → configuring (handshake attempt) → downloading (engine bundle)
 *        → warming (TF runtime + model + dummy inferences) → ready | error
 *
 * Operating modes (commercial boundary, see ARCHITECTURE.md §Modes):
 * - 'keypoints-only': always reachable — online MoveNet (CDN TF.js + model
 *   URL) + warm-up + camera pipeline, raw `keypoints` events only. A failed
 *   handshake (offline API, missing/invalid token, quota) NEVER blocks
 *   `ready`: it degrades to this mode with a non-fatal `error` event.
 *   `error` status is reserved for unrecoverable local failures (model load).
 * - 'full-engine': requires a validated handshake — live, or replayed from
 *   the encrypted session cache written after a previous successful
 *   handshake (Sency-style offline cold start). The npm package itself
 *   ships ZERO movement intelligence.
 *
 * The mode upgrades at runtime without restarting the camera pipeline:
 * `configure()` can be called at any time (e.g. when the network comes back
 * or the host obtains a token) — the inference backend is untouched, and
 * business events simply start flowing once the engine is up.
